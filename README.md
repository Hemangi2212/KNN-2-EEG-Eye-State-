# KNN-2-EEG-Eye-State-
EEG Eye State Classification is a machine learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a person’s eyes are open or closed based on EEG signal data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using Python.
